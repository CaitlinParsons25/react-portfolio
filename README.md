This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Aims of the project
1. Create a portfolio page showcasing my coding projects
2. Include a section about me and a section to contact me
3. Have a header with navigation to the various sections
4. Include a footer with various profile links

## 1. Create a portfolio page showcasing my coding projects
This is a single-page app (SPA) on which I can showcase the various coding project I have worked on with deploy and GitHub repository links.

## 2. Include a section "about" and a section with a form to contact me
There is an "About" section with a brief bio and picture, as well as a form so that site visitors can contact me if they wish.

## 3. Have a header with navigation to the various sections
The header includes my name and the names of the three sections, and clicking on the name of a section will take you to that part of the SPA.

## 4. Include a footer with various profile links
The footer has links to my GitHub profile, my LinkedIn profile, and my Stack Overflow profile.
